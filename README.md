<h1>SkyHelper</h1>
A Minecraft 1.8.9 mod designed to improve the Hypixel SkyBlock mining experience with a bunch of helpful (and chaotic) automation features.

Inspired by MightyMinerv2 and proudly made of spaghetti code 🍝 — you've been warned.

This mod should be a temporary macro while MM is not updated

PS: I'm just starting with Minecraft modding, so please set your expectations low. 😅
